// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing & Integration
Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "With our goal in mind we need to define and document our requirements. Finding the tools and technolgy that will be helpful."
const design = "Finding what the product looks like and seeing what pieces are needed to create the desired look."
const implementation = "The sit down and coding piece of a project. Writing code to be tested."
const testingAndIntegration = "Going over code and seeing it there are any error. Then push the code out for people that are going to use it."
const maintain = "Checking on the code after time to make sure the program still functions as expected."
